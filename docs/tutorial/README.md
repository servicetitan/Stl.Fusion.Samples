Welcome to [Fusion] Tutorial! It used to be interactive, but thanks to Microsoft's inability to maintain `dotnet try` tool, this nice feature currently doesn't work.

## Running Tutorial

**NOTE: Currently you can't run the Tutorial**, and Microsoft is the one to blame: they don't maintain `dotnet try` tool, which still targets only .NET Core 3.1. But if you want, you can still *try*.

Running with [Docker]:

- Install and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Run `docker-compose up --build tutorial` in the root folder of this repository
- Open https://localhost:50005/README.md.

Alternatively, you can run it with `dotnet try` CLI tool:

- Install **both**
  [.NET 8.0 Preview SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and
  [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- Install [Try .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/try/blob/master/DotNetTryLocal.md).
  If its release version fails to run the code, install its preview version.
- Run `dotnet try --port 50005 docs/tutorial` in the root folder of this repository
- Open https://localhost:50005/README.md.
