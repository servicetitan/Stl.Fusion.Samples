# Part 10: Multi-Host Invalidation and CQRS with Operations Framework

If you read [Part 8](./Part08.md), you know that multi-host
invalidation requires the following components:

1. **Command execution pipeline.**
2. **Command logger** - a handler in this pipeline responsible
   for logging commands to some persistent store - and ideally,
   doing this as part of command's own transaction.
3. **Command log reader** - a service watching for command log
   updates made by other processes.
4. An API allowing to "replay" a command in invalidation mode -
   i.e. run a part of command's logic responsible solely for
   invalidation.

Operations Framework implements this in a very robust way.

## Operations Framework

Useful definitions:

OF
: A shortcut for Operations Framework used further

Operation
: An action that could be logged into operation log and replayed.
So far only commands could act as such actions, but for now
the framework implies there might be other kinds of
operations too. So operation is ~ whatever OF can handle as
an operation, including commands.

It worth mentioning that OF has almost zero dependency on
Fusion. You can use it for other purposes too
(e.g. audit logging) - with or without Fusion.
Moreover, you can easily remove all Fusion-specific services
it has from IoC container to completely disable
its Fusion-specific behaviors.

### Enabling Operations Framework

1. Add the following `DbSet` to your `DbContext` (`AppDbContext` further):

```cs
public DbSet<DbOperation> Operations { get; protected set; } = null!;
```

2. Add the following code to your server-side IoC container
   configuration block
   (typically it is `Startup.ConfigureServices` method):

```cs
services.AddDbContextServices<AppDbContext>(db => {
    // Uncomment if you'll be using AddRedisOperationLogChangeTracking 
    // db.AddRedisDb("localhost", "Fusion.Tutorial.Part10");
    
    db.AddOperations(operations => {
        // This call enabled Operations Framework (OF) for AppDbContext. 
        operations.ConfigureOperationLogReader(_ => new() {
            // We use FileBasedDbOperationLogChangeTracking, so unconditional wake up period
            // can be arbitrary long - all depends on the reliability of Notifier-Monitor chain.
            // See what .ToRandom does - most of timeouts in Fusion settings are RandomTimeSpan-s,
            // but you can provide a normal one too - there is an implicit conversion from it.
            UnconditionalCheckPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Env.IsDevelopment() ? 60 : 5).ToRandom(0.05),
        });
        // Optionally enable file-based log change tracker 
        operations.AddFileBasedOperationLogChangeTracking();
        
        // Or, if you use PostgreSQL, use this instead of above line
        // operations.AddNpgsqlOperationLogChangeTracking();
        
        // Or, if you use Redis, use this instead of above line
        // operations.AddRedisOperationLogChangeTracking();
    });
});
```

What happens here?

- `AddDbContextServices<TDbContext>(Action<DbContextBuilder<TDbcontext>>)`
  is a convenience helper allowing methods like `AddOperations`
  to be implemented as extension methods to `DbContextBuilder<TDbcontext>`,
  so you as a user of such methods need to specify `TDbContext` type
  just once - when you call `AddDbContextServices`. In other
  words, `AddDbContextServices` does nothing itself, but allows
  services registered inside its builder block to be dependent on
  `TDbContext` type.
- `AddOperations` does nearly all the job. I'll cover every service
  it registers in details further.
- And finally, `AddXxxDbOperationLogChangeTracking` adds one of two
  services implementing log change tracking notification / listening.
  It's totally fine to omit any of these calls - in this case
  operation log reader will be waking up only unconditionally, which
  happens 4 times per second by default, so other hosts running
  your code may see 0.25s delay in invalidations of data changed by
  their peers. You can reduce this delay, of course, but doing this
  means you'll be hitting the database more frequently with operation
  log tail requests. `AddXxxDbOperationLogChangeTracking` methods
  make this part way more efficient by explicitly notifying the log
  reader to read the tail as soon as they know for sure one of their
  peers updated it:
  - `AddFileBasedOperationLogChangeTracking` relies on a shared file
    to pass these notifications. Any peer that updates operation log
    also "touches" this file (just update its modify date), and all
    other peers are using `FileSystemWatcher`-s to know about these
    touches as soon as they happen. And once they happen, they "wake up"
    the operation log reader.
  - `AddNpgsqlOperationLogChangeTracking` does ~ the same, but
    relying on PostgreSQL's
    [NOTIFY / LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-notify.html)
    feature - basically, a built-in message queue.
    If you use PostgreSQL, you should almost definitely use it.
    It's also a bit more efficient than file-based notifications,
    because such notifications also bear the Id of the agent
    that made the change, so the listening process on that agent
    has a change to ignore any of its own notifications.
  - Right now there are no other log change tracking options, but
    more are upcoming. And it's fairly easy to add your own -
    e.g. [PostgreSQL log change tracking](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/tree/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework.Npgsql/Operations)
    requires less than 200 lines of code, and you need to change
    maybe just 30-40 of these lines in your own tracker.

## Using Operations Framework

Here is how Operations Framework requires you to transform
the code of your old action handlers:

**Pre-OF handler:**

```cs
public async Task<ChatMessage> PostMessage(
    Session session, string text, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    await using var dbContext = CreateDbContext().ReadWrite();
    // Actual code...

    // Invalidation
    using (Computed.Invalidate())
        _ = PseudoGetAnyChatTail();
    return message;
}
```

**Post-OF handler:**

‎1. Create a dedicated command type for this action:

```cs
public record PostMessageCommand(Session Session, string Text) : ICommand<ChatMessage>
{
    // Newtonsoft.Json needs this constructor to deserialize this record
    public PostMessageCommand() : this(Session.Null, "") { } 
}
```

Notice that above type implements `ICommand<ChatMessage>` - the
generic parameter `ChatMessage` here is the type of result of
this command.

Even though it's a record type in this example, there is no requirement
like "every command has to be a record". Any JSON-serializable
class will work equally well; I prefer to use records mostly due
to their immutability.

‎2. Refactor action to command handler:

```cs
[CommandHandler]
public virtual async Task<ChatMessage> PostMessage(
    PostMessageCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (Computed.IsInvalidating()) {
        _ = PseudoGetAnyChatTail();
        return default!;
    }

    await using var dbContext = await CreateCommandDbContext(cancellationToken);
    // The same action handler code as it was in example above.
}
```

A recap from [Part 8](./Part08.md) of how `[CommandHandler]`s
should look like:

- Add `virtual` + tag the method with `[CommandHandler]`.
  You can apply it to corresponding interface member as well,
  the attribute is "inherited" and can be "overriden" like
  `[ComputeMethod]` does too.
- New method arguments: `(PostCommand, CancellationToken)`
- New return type: `Task<ChatMessage>`. Notice that
  `ChatMessage` is a generic parameter of its command too -
  and these types should match unless your command implements
  `ICommand<Unit>` or you write filtering handler (in these case
  it can be `Task` too).
- The method must be `public` or `protected`.

The invalidation block inside the handler should be transformed too:

- Move it to the very beginning of the method
- Replace `using (Computed.Invalidate()) { Code(); }` construction
  with
  `if (Computed.IsInvalidating()) { Code(); return default!; }`.
- If your service derives from `DbServiceBase` or `DbAsyncProcessBase`,
  you should use its protected `CreateCommandDbContext` method
  to get `DbContext` where you are going to make changes.
  You still have to call `SaveAsync` on this `DbContext` in the end.

And two last things 😋:

‎1. You can't pass values from the "main" block to the
invalidation block directly.
It's not just due to their new order - the code from your
invalidation blocks will run a few times for every command
execution (once on every host), but the "main" block's code
will run only on the host where the command was started.

So to pass some data to your invalidation blocks, use
`CommandContext.Operation().Items` collection -
nearly as follows:

```cs
public virtual async Task SignOut(
    SignOutCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    // ...
    var context = CommandContext.GetCurrent();
    if (Computed.IsInvalidating()) {
        // Fetch operation item
        var invSessionInfo = context.Operation().Items.Get<SessionInfo>();
        if (invSessionInfo != null) {
            // Use it
            _ = GetUser(invSessionInfo.UserId, default);
            _ = GetUserSessions(invSessionInfo.UserId, default);
        }
        return;
    }

    await using var dbContext = await CreateCommandDbContext(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);

    var dbSessionInfo = await Sessions.FindOrCreate(dbContext, session, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    var sessionInfo = dbSessionInfo.ToModel();
    if (sessionInfo.IsSignOutForced)
        return;
    
    // Store operation item for invalidation logic
    context.Operation().Items.Set(sessionInfo);
    // ... 
}
```

‎2. Calling some other commands from your own commands is totally fine:
OF logs & "plays" their invalidation logic on other hosts too,
it also isolates their own operation items.

That's mostly it. Now, if you're curious how it works - continue reading.
Otherwise you can simply try this. To see this in action, try running:

- `Run-Sample-Blazor-MultiHost.cmd` from
  [Fusion Samples](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion.Samples)
- `Run-MultiHost.cmd` from
  [Board Games](https://github.com/alexyakunin/BoardGames).

## How all of this works?

OF adds a number of generic filtering command handlers to `Commander`'s
pipeline, and they - together with a couple other services - do all the
heavy-lifting.

- "Generic" means they handle `ICommand` - the very base type for
  any command you create
- "Filtering" means they act like middlewares in ASP.NET Core, so
  in fact, they "wrap" the execution of downstream handlers with
  their own prologue/epilogue logic.

Here is the list of such handlers in their invocation order:

### 1. `PreparedCommandHandler`, priority: `1_000_000_001` and  `1_000_000_000`

This filtering handler simply invokes `IPreparedCommand.Prepare`
(higher priority) and `IAsyncPreparedCommand.PrepareAsync` (lower priority)
on commands that implement these interfaces, where some pre-execution
validation or fixup is supposed to happen. And as you might judge by
the priority, this supposed to happen before anything else.

You may find out this handler is actually a part of `Stl.CommandR`,
and it's auto-registered when you call `.AddCommander(...)`, so
it's a "system" command validation handler.

The only command that currently implements validation is
`ServerSideCommandBase<TResult>` - actually, a super-important
base type for commands that can be invoked on server-side only.
Check out
[its source code](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.CommandR/Commands/ServerSideCommandBase.cs) -
it's super simple, and it's clear how it's supposed to work:

- If you inherit your command from `ServerSideCommandBase<TResult>`
  it will expose `IsServerSide` property, which isn't serialized.
  So creating a command with `IsServerSide = true` is possible
  on the client, but this flag will be lost once it gets
  deserialized on the server side.
- `IServerSideCommand` implements `IPreparedCommand`, and
  `ServerSideCommandBase.Prepare` fails if `IsServerSide == false`.
  So you can run such commands on server by explicitly settings
  this flag to `true` there - the best way to do this is to use
  `MarkServerSide()` extension method, which returns the command
  of the same type, but with this flag set to `true`

### 2. `NestedCommandLogger`, priority: 11_000

This filter is responsible for logging all nested commands,
i.e. commands called while running other commands.

It's implied that each command implements its own invalidation logic,
so "parent" commands shouldn't do anything special to process
invalidations for "child" commands - and thanks to this handler,
they shouldn't even call them explicitly inside the invalidation
block - it happens automatically.

I won't dig into the details of how it works just yet,
let's just assume it does the job - for now.

### 3. `TransientOperationScopeProvider`, priority: 10_000

It is the outermost, "catch-all" operation scope provider
for commands that don't use any other (real) operation scopes.

Let me explain what all of this means now 😈

Your app may have a few different types of `DbContext`-s,
or maybe even other (non-EF) storages.
And since it's a bad idea to assume we run distributed
transactions across all of them, OF assumes each of these
storages (i.e. `DbContext` types) has its own operation log,
and an operation entry is added to this log inside the same
transaction, that run operation's own logic.

So to achieve that, OF assumes there are "operation scope providers" -
command filters that publish different implementations of
`IOperationScope` via `CommandContext.Items` (in case you don't
remember, `CommandContext.Items` is `HttpContext.Items` analog
in CommandR-s world). And when the final command handler runs,
it should pick the right one of these scopes to get access
to the underlying storage. Here is how this happens, if we're
talking about EF:

- `DbOperationScopeProvider<TDbContext>`
  [creates and "injects"](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/Operations/DbOperationScopeProvider.cs#L54)
  `DbOperationScope<TDbContext>` into
  `CommandContext.GetCurrent().Items` collection.
- Once your service needs to access `AppDbContext` from the
  command handler, it typically calls its protected
  `CreateCommandDbContext` method, which
  ["pulls" the `DbOperationScope<AppDbContext>`](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/DbServiceBase.cs#L38)
  and asks it to provide actual `AppDbContext`.
- Finally, `DbOperationScope.CreateDbContext` does all the magic:
  when you call this method for the first time, not only it creates
  "primary" `DbContext`, but also starts a new transaction there.
  And when you call it later, it creates a `DbContext` that
  [shares the same `DbConnection`](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/DbOperationScope.cs#L107)
  as the the "primary" one.

In other words, `DbOperationScope` ensures that all `DbContext`-s
you get via it share the same connection and transaction.
In addition, it ensures that
[an operation entry is added to the operation log before this
transaction gets committed, and the fact commit actually  happened
is verified in case of failure](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/DbOperationScope.cs#L133).
If you're curious why it makes sense to do this,
[see this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/fundamentals/connection-resiliency/commit-failures).

Now, back to `TransientOperationScopeProvider` - its job
is to provide an operation scope for commands that don't use
other operation scopes - e.g. the ones that change only
in-memory state. If your command doesn't use one of APIs
"pinning" it to some other operation scope, this is the
scope it's going to use implicitly.

Finally, it has another grand role: it runs so-called
operation completion for all operations, i.e. not only
the transient ones. And this piece deserves its own
section:

### What is Operation Completion?

It's a process that happens on invocation of
`OperationCompletionNotifier.NotifyCompleted(operation)`.
`IOperationCompletionNotifier` is a service simply "distributes" such
notifications to `IOperationCompletionListener`-s after eliminating
all *duplicate notifications* (based on `IOperation.Id`). By default,
it remembers up to 10K of up to 1-hour-old operations (more precisely,
their `Id`-s and commit times).

Even though it invokes all the handlers concurrently,
`NotifyCompletedAsync` completes when *all*
`IOperationCompletionListener.OnOperationCompletedAsync` handlers
complete. So once `NotifyCompletedAsync` completes, you
can be certain that every of these "follow up" actions is already
completed as well.

[`CompletionProducer` (check it out, it's tiny)](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/Operations/Internal/CompletionProducer.cs#L34) -
is probably the most important one of such listeners.
The critical part of its job is actually a single line:

```cs
await Commander.Call(Completion.New(operation), true).ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Two things are happening here:

1. It creates [`Completion<TCommand>` object](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/Operations/Completion.cs) -
   in fact, a command as well!
2. It runs this command via `Commander.Call(completion, true)`.

The last argument (`isolate = true`) indicates that `ExecutionContext`
flow will be suppressed for this `Commander` invocation,
so the pipeline for this command won't "inherit" any of
`AsyncLocal`-s, including `CommandContext.Current`.
In other words, the command will run in a new top-level
`CommandContext` and won't have a chance to "inherit"
any state via async locals.

For the note, it's a kind of overkill, because
`OperationCompletionNotifier` also suppresses `ExecutionContext`
flow when it runs listeners. But... Just in case :)

Now, notice that `ICompletion` implements `IMetaCommand` interface -
a tagging interface for various "follow up" commands that aren't
executed directly, but invoked by some pipeline handlers.
Some of generic command handlers have special checks
for such commands - e.g. you might notice that
`Completion<SomeCommand>` will never push another
`Completion<Completion<SomeCommand>>` into the pipeline
due to one of such checks.

Any `IMetaCommand` implements `IServerSideCommand`,
so it will run successfully only when it's marked as such.
And indeed, the `Completion.New` does this:

```cs
public static ICompletion New(IOperation operation)
{
    var command = (ICommand?) operation.Command
        ?? throw Errors.OperationHasNoCommand(nameof(operation));
    var tCompletion = typeof(Completion<>).MakeGenericType(command.GetType());
    var completion = (ICompletion) tCompletion.CreateInstance(operation)!;
    return completion.MarkServerSide();
}
```

Above code also shows that the actual type of command becomes
a value of generic parameter of `Completion<T>` type.
So if you want to implement a *reaction to completion* of e.g.
`MyCommand` - just declare a filtering command handler
for `ICompletion<MyCommand>`. And yes, it's better to use
`ICompletion<T>` rather than `Completion<T>` in such handlers.

So what is operation completion?

- It's invocation of
  `OperationCompletionNotifier.NotifyCompleted(operation)`
- Which in turn invokes all operation completion listeners
  - One of such listeners - `CompletionProducer` - reacts
    to this by creating a "meta command" of
    `ICompletion<TCommand>` type and invoking `Commander` for
    this new command.
    Later you'll learn the invalidation pass is actually
    triggered by a handler reacting to this command.
  - And if you registered any of operation log change notifiers,
    all of them currently implement `IOperationCompletionListener`
    notifying their peers that operation log was just updated.

Now, a couple good questions:

> Q: Why `NotifyCompletedAsync` doesn't return instantly?
> Why it bothers to await completion of each and every handler?

This ensures that once the invocation of this method
from `TransientOperationScopeProvider`
is completed, every follow-up action related to it is
completed as well, including invalidation.

In other words, our command processing pipeline is built
in such a way that once a command completes, you can be
fully certain that any pipeline-based follow-up action
is completed for it as well - including invalidation.

> Q: What else invokes `NotifyCompletedAsync`?

Just `DbOperationLogReader` -
[see how it does this](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/Operations/DbOperationLogReader.cs#L51).

As you might notice, it skips all local commands, and a big
comment there explains why it does so.

> Q: So every host invokes some logic for every command
> running on other hosts?

Yes. All of this means that:

- Even though there are typically way more queries than
  commands,  some actions (e.g. presence info updates)
  might be quite frequent. And you should avoid hitting
  the DB or running any resource-consuming activities
  inside your invalidation blocks. Especially -
  inside such blocks for frequent actions.
- If you know for sure that at some point you'll
  reach the scale that won't allow you to rely on
  a single operation log (e.g. an extremely high
  frequency of "read tail" calls from ~ hundreds of
  hosts may bring it down), or e.g. that even
  replaying the invalidations for every command
  won't be possible - you need to think how to
  partition your system.

For the note, invalidations are extremely fast -
it's safe to assume they are ~ as fast as identical
calls resolving via `IComptuted` instances, i.e.
it's safe to assume you can run ~ a 1 million of
invalidations per second per HT core, which
means that an extremely high command rate is
needed to "flood" OF's invalidation pipeline,
and most likely it won't be due to the cost of
invalidation. JSON deserialization and
CommandR pipeline itself is much more likely
to become a bottleneck under extreme load.

Ok, back to our command execution pipeline 😁

### 4. `DbOperationScopeProvider<TDbContext>`, priority: 1000

This filter provides `DbOperationScope<TDbContext>`, i.e. the
"real" operation scope for your operations. As you probably
already guessed, the fact this filter exists in the pipeline
doesn't mean it always creates some `DbContext` and
transaction to commit the operation to.
This happens if and only if:

- You the `DbOperationScope<TDbContext>` it created for you - e.g. by calling
  `CommandContext.GetCurrent().Items.Get<DbOperationScope<AppDbContext>>()`
- And ask this scope to provide a `DbContext` by calling its
  `CreateDbContextAsync` method, which indicates
  you're going to use this operation scope.

> Note: if your service derives from `DbServiceBase` or `DbAsyncProcessBase`,
> they provide `CreateCommandDbContext` method, which is actually
> a shortcut for above actions. If you like the idea of such shortcuts,
> derive your DB-related services from one of these types or their
> descendants like `DbWakeSleepProcessBase`.

### 5. `InvalidateOnCompletionCommandHandler`, priority: 100

Let's look at its handler declaration first:

```cs
[CommandHandler(Priority = 100, IsFilter = true)]
public async Task OnCommand(
  ICompletion command, CommandContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{ 
    //  ... 
}
```

As you might guess, it reacts to the *completion* of any command,
and runs the original command **plus** every nested
command logged during its execution in the "invalidation mode" -
i.e. inside `Computed.Invalidate()` block.
This is why your command handlers need a branch checking for
`Computed.IsInvalidating() == true` running the invalidation logic
there!

You're [welcome to see what it actually does](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/Operations/Internal/InvalidateOnCompletionCommandHandler.cs#L45) -
it's a fairly simple code, the only tricky piece is related to nested operations.

On a positive side, `InvalidateOnCompletionCommandHandler` is the last
filter in the pipeline, so we can switch to this topic + one other important
aspect - **operation items**.

## Operation items

API endpoint: `commandContext.Operation().Items`

It's actually a pretty simple abstraction allowing you to store
some data together with the operation - so once its completion
is "played" on this or other hosts, this data is readily available.

I'll show how it's used in one of Fusion's built-in command handlers -
[`SignOutCommand` handler of `DbAuthService`](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/Authentication/DbAuthService.cs#L39):

```cs
public override async Task SignOut(
    SignOutCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var (session, force) = command;
    var context = CommandContext.GetCurrent();
    if (Computed.IsInvalidating()) {
        _ = GetAuthInfo(session, default);
        _ = GetSessionInfo(session, default);
        if (force) {
            _ = IsSignOutForced(session, default);
            _ = GetOptions(session, default);
        }
        var invSessionInfo = context.Operation().Items.Get<SessionInfo>();
        if (invSessionInfo != null) {
            _ = GetUser(invSessionInfo.UserId, default);
            _ = GetUserSessions(invSessionInfo.UserId, default);
        }
        return;
    }

    var dbContext = await CreateCommandDbContext(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    await using var _1 = dbContext.ConfigureAwait(false);

    var dbSessionInfo = await Sessions.GetOrCreate(dbContext, session.Id, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    var sessionInfo = SessionConverter.ToModel(dbSessionInfo);
    if (sessionInfo!.IsSignOutForced)
        return;

    context.Operation().Items.Set(sessionInfo);
    sessionInfo = sessionInfo with {
        LastSeenAt = Clocks.SystemClock.Now,
        AuthenticatedIdentity = "",
        UserId = "",
        IsSignOutForced = force,
    };
    await Sessions.Upsert(dbContext, sessionInfo, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
}
```

First, look at this line inside the invalidation block:

```cs
var invSessionInfo = context.Operation().Items.Get<SessionInfo>()
```

It tries to pull `SessionInfo` object from `Operation().Items`. But why?
Well, because needs **pre-sign-out** `SessionInfo` that still contains
`UserId`. And the code that goes after this call invalidates results of
a few other methods related to this user.

The code that stores this info is located below:

```cs
context.Operation().Items.Set(sessionInfo);
```

As you see, it stores `sessionInfo` object into
`context.Operation().Items` right before creating its copy
with wiped out `UserId` - in other words, *it saves
the info it wipes for the invalidation logic*.

And this is precisely the purpose of this API - to pass
some information related to the operation to "follow up" actions
(currently "invalidation pass" is the only follow-up action).
As you might guess, this info is stored in the DB along with
the operation, so peer hosts will see it as well while
running their own invalidation logic.

> Q: How this differs from `CommandContext.Items`?

`CommandContext.Items` live only while the top-level command runs.
They aren't persisted anywhere, and thus they won't be available
on peer hosts too.

But importantly, both these objects are `OptionSet`-s.
Check out [its source code](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl/Collections/OptionSet.cs)
to learn how it works - again, it's a fairly tiny class.

## Nested command logging

I'll be brief here. Nested commands are logged into one
of operation items - you may quickly find that its type is
`ImmutableList<NestedCommandEntry>`.

- The logging is happening in `NestedCommandLogger` type.
  You might notice that nested commands of nested commands
  are properly logged too - moreover, their `Operation().Items`
  are captured & stored independently as well! In other words,
  you're free to call other commands from your commands w/o a need
  to worry about their invalidation piece of work (it will happen)
  or collisions of their operation items with yours.
- The "invalidation mode replay" of these commands is performed by
  `InvalidateOnCompletionCommandHandler`.

There is nothing like a "generic" handler triggering completion
for such commands - as you might guess, completion is meaningful
for top-level commands only. Nested commands are captured
and stored solely to simplify invalidation, and if this piece
won't be there, you'd have to manually duplicate any logic
triggering commands both in the "main" and in the "invalidation"
sections. Luckily, I'm a big fan of DRY, so I had no choice
other than solving this problem once and forever 😎

## How can I learn Operation Framework deeper?

The easiest way to find all the components used by Operations
Framework is to see the implementation of `DbContextBuilder.AddOperations`
and `IServiceCollection.AddFusion`. Both methods invoke corresponding 
builder's constructor first, which I highly recommend to view: 

- https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion.EntityFramework/DbOperationsBuilder.cs#L25
- https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/FusionBuilder.cs#L46

Below is a brief description of some of the services I didn't mention yet;
as for anything else, above code is the best place to start digging
into the Operations Framework a bit deeper.

`AgentInfo` is a simple type allowing Operations Framework to check 
if an operation is originating from this or some other process.
Check out its [source code](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/Operations/AgentInfo.cs) -
it's tiny.

As you see, `AgentInfo.Id` is ~ a `Symbol` that includes:

- Machine name
- Unique process ID
- Unique ID for every new `AgentInfo` you create. This
  ensures that you can run a number of IoC containers with
  different services inside the same process & use OF
  to "sync" them. This is super useful for testing any
  OF related aspects (e.g. that all of your commands are
  actually "replayed" in invalidation mode on other hosts).

`InvalidationInfoProvider` is a service that tells whether
a given command requires invalidation.
Its default implementation returns `true` for any command with
a final handler that lives inside `IComputeService`, but
not `IReplicaService`
([details](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion/blob/master/src/Stl.Fusion/Operations/InvalidationInfoProvider.cs#L38)).

Why not `IReplicaService`, you might guess? Because
replica services are allowed to register their command
handlers on the client side too, and since these handler
are routing commands to corresponding server-side services,
the invalidation and any other post-processing should
happen there, but not on the client.

`IDbOperationLog` is a repository-like service providing access
to DB operation log.

P.S. I certainly realize that even though OF's usage is fairly
simple on the outside, there is a complex API with many moving
parts inside. And probably, some bugs.
